##Spark Nest

Creating a spark based nest.

###Sketch Functionality

The sketch file wires up a few things. 

1. A remote function to write a smiley or frowny face to the LED Backpack
2. A PIR Motion sensor reading
3. Using the reading from the PIR sensor to make the LED Backpack smile or frown. If moving the LED will frown if not moving it will smile.
